Warning: This relies on an unreleased version of Dispatch.

# Dispatch Catalog

The official [Dispatch](https://docs.d2iq.com/ksphere/dispatch/latest/) catalog. Currently, this only hosts our Starlark standard library, however, this will grow to include other resources.

Check out the [Starlark standard library documentation](./starlark/) for more information.

## Contributing

To test your changes, run `make build` which will render the documentation, syntax check all of the code, and run any unit tests defined.

Please refer to the [Starlark reference](https://docs.d2iq.com/ksphere/dispatch/latest/references/starlark-reference/) for details on writing Starlark methods.
